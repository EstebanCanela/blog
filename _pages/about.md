Hi everyone ! I'm Esteban Canela.

I'm a Technical Backend Lead at Pomelo. I've worked in the core product, Payment Processor, in which I've led a team building the integration with Mastercard Network and process their messages.
In this project we've used a big number of technologies but mainly Golang, Java and many features from AWS.

I enjoy to solve hard problems of any type, especially those are related to distributed systems and web3.

Before Pomelo, I worked in Naranja X, one of the most important neobank in Argentina with 2M of customers.
In this company I spent my time working in projects like:

- Home: Our main objective was building a Home service that response quickly to our users. For this requirement I designed the new architecture, developed, tested and monitored those backend microservices using a modern tech stack like Node.js, Express, Golang, Datadog, Redis, PostgreSQL.
- Service payment: I designed the architecture and built a core of services that helps users pay their bills. I developed the integration with Western Union API focused on scalability and resilience. Those microservices scaled to 2M of bills paid per month.
